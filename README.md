# HomeTrack
Real estate website


We use this repository to build a real estate website.

HomeTrack  is a website that enables users to search and buy real estates on the Internet.

In the framework of this project, we are creating a website that enables the purchase of real estates.

Our idea is to have 5 screens: home, explore, contact, blog and SignUp/LogIn.

The home page will contain recently added real estates, basic information about HomeTrack and recommended real estates. Explore page will contain search bar, recently added real estates, recommended real estates and most viewed real estates. Contact page will contain contact form that enables users to send inquiry and blog page will contain interesting articles related to real estate.

The project is done for educational purposes and my colleague Marin BaraÄ‡ and I will work on it.
